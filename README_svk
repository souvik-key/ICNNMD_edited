## --- Problem with tensorflow version (26th Jan 2023) --- ###

1. In genova: NVIDIA-SMI 440.31       Driver Version: 440.31       CUDA Version: 10.2

Because Cuda Toolkit 11.2 minimum needs a driver version >= 450.80.02, only possible tensorflow-gpu was: tensorflow-2.3.0; Cudann:	7.6; cudatoolkit: 10.1
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=10.1 cudnn=7.6.0
3. However, tensorflow 2.3.0 requires numpy<1.19.0,>=1.16.0, but current mdtraj need numpy needs it > 1.2.0. So now it makes the choice difficult. May be we have to get back to cpu version of tensorflow. 

4. Because of the above issue, we would have a lot of library conflict. Hence we downgrade to cpu version

5. Uninstalled cudatoolkit, cudnn, tensorflow, numpy, mdtraj

6. installed numpy=1.21 as the latest 1.24 has some incompatibility with current tensorflow=2.11; installed mdtraj

7. TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2 python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))" to check tf installation and suppress gpu related warnings

8. also added :

import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'

to 'main.py' to suppress the same warnings related to gpu usage

9. multiple additions/edits are done for version based module deprecations


11. if problem with libstd++.so.6 library, try adding "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/aakash/anaconda3/envs/py38/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" to the ~/.bashrc.
